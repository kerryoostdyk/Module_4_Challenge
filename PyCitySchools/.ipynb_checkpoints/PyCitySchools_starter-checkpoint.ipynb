    "-When comparing the overall passing rates between school size, the medium size schools have the highest overall passing rate. The smallest schools were close behind the medium schools. The difference between medium and small was less than 1%.  However there was a significant difference between the large schools at 58% overall passing to the medium schools at 91%. \n",

    "-Charter schools had a much higher overall passing rate than district schools. The charter schools were at a 90% passing rate compared to the disticts overall rate of 54%. This could be for many different reasons, like parent involvment for example, but further research should be done to determine the cause of this difference. "
